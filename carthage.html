            <p>Carthage is a city steeped in history, culture, and beauty, located on the Mediterranean coast of Tunisia. This ancient city was once one of the most powerful in the world, and its ruins continue to attract visitors from around the globe</p>
            <br><p>Carthage was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenician settlers, and quickly grew into a major commercial and maritime power. It played a key role in the Mediterranean trade network, and its merchants were renowned for their wealth and influence. The city was also a major cultural center, with a vibrant artistic and intellectual scene.</p>
            <br><p>Today, visitors to Carthage can explore its many historic sites and learn about its rich past. The most famous of these sites is the Carthage Archaeological Site, which includes the ruins of the ancient city and a museum showcasing its artifacts. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and features stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
            <p>One of the most impressive structures within the Carthage Archaeological Site is the Antonine Baths, which were once the largest Roman baths outside of Rome. Visitors can still see the remains of the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath), as well as the ruins of the hypocaust system that heated the baths.</p>
